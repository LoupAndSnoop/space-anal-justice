This is a Space Age rebalance mod. It changes several key points of balance without fundamentally changing the complexity.

# Changes

Vulcanus:
- Vulcanus petrochemistry is supposed to be its weakness, coal liquefaction is now weaker.
- Metallurgic science never made sense with Vulcanus' theme. So now its recipe is all about big scale metal casting.

Fulgora:
- Holmium is more abundant via holmium solution recipe.

Gleba:
- Biochamber is much stronger (especially outside Gleba). It has more module slots, more base productivity, and more recipes.
- Bioflux can now be recycled with jelly/mash (but only on Gleba!) to make quality grinding viable. 

Aquilo:
- Cryo plant can now make chemical science.

# Notes

- May not be compatible with several overhauls.
- May interfere with balance changes from mod planets. Eg if every mod planet adds something for holmium, making holmium more abundant will relatively nerf their rewards.
