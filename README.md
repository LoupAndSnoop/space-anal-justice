This is a Space Age rebalance mod. It changes several key points of balance without fundamentally changing the complexity. It should not be added mid-playthrough, and it is opinionated.

----
# Change List

## Vulcanus:
- Coal liquefaction is now weaker (slower amd less output), because Vulcanus petrochemistry is supposed to be its weakness.
- Metallurgic science recipe changed to be about big scale metal casting.

## Fulgora:
- Holmium is more abundant via holmium solution recipe.
- Several recycler recipes used for voiding are now substantially faster, to aid with scaling things up on Fulgora.
- Scrap now requires lubricant to mine.
- Holmium solution can be made with a biochamber for better productivity.

## Gleba:
- Biochamber is much stronger (especially outside Gleba). It has more module slots, more base productivity, and more recipes.
- Gleba evolution now scales with how many agriculture science packs were made, to guarantee time to defend yourself.
- To incentivise Glebase-building, agriculture science instead requires plastic, iron bacteria, and rocket fuel. Iron ore can now be recycled by biochamber.
- Agriculture science is always made fresh.
- Efficiency module 3 is slightly stronger.
- Fruit processing now yields very slightly more seeds, to accelerate growth and give more tolerance for new players.
- Rocket turret now has a bigger range and rockets are faster. This allows rocket turrets to much more effectively defend Gleba.
- Bioflux can now be recycled with jelly/mash (but only on Gleba!) to make quality grinding viable.

## Aquilo:
- Cryo plant can now make chemical science.
- Railgun damage reesearch now needs cryo science packs.
- Regular labs can no longer use cryogenic/promethium science packs.

## Space:
- Crushers now have a small bit of negative quality bonus. Space casinos are still doable and viable, but don't pop off as hard.
- Productivity no longer applies to the asteroid chunk that you get back out from a crushing or advanced crushing recipe.

## Quality / General:
- Beacon effect distribution now scales less with quality.
- Speed3 and Producitivity3 modules slightly nerfed, because they really let you run over unique traits of planets when you have them in quality.
- LDS shuffle and processing unit upcycling nerfed by making it's max prod slightly less than 300%. It's still good, but no longer 100% free.

# Notes

- May not be compatible with several overhauls.
- May interfere with balance changes from mod planets. Eg if every mod planet adds something for holmium, making holmium more abundant will relatively nerf their rewards.
